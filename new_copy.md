## Purpose

I created Pure Glow Wellness to help people feel comfortable in their own skin.

I offer tailored facials, relaxation-focused wellbeing treatments, and natural skincare support — all delivered in a calm, unrushed way, with time to talk and treatments adapted to you on the day.

## Caroline Hines  
### My story

Hello, I’m Caroline. I’m 51, married to my Aussie husband Mic, a proud mum of three gorgeous children, and dog mum to two lively pups. I’ve been a Marpler since the age of seven, and today I’m living out a dream I never expected: running my own holistic skin and wellbeing retreat from my garden.

My working life began in the beauty industry as a hairdresser before I moved into finance and insurance. In 2021, everything changed when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. After successful treatment, I knew I wanted to do something more meaningful — something that helped people feel supported, relaxed, and cared for.

## One umbrella, three strands

Pure Glow brings together skin, wellbeing, and confidence-focused care — all rooted in calm, tailored support rather than rushed, one-size-fits-all treatments.

### Pure Glow Facials
Relaxing, skin-supporting facials tailored to your needs on the day. Each treatment begins with a conversation about what you want from it, followed by carefully chosen products and techniques to suit your skin. Calm, holistic, and never routine.

### Pure Glow Wellbeing
Relaxation-focused treatments designed to release tension, calm the nervous system, and help you properly switch off — especially during busy or stressful periods.

### Pure Glow Corporate
Wellbeing sessions for workplaces, offering moments of calm and care during high-pressure times. Ideal for events, busy seasons, or supporting staff wellbeing in a more personal way.

## What clients say about Pure Glow

Feedback from clients across facials, massage, and wellbeing treatments.

> “I had the pleasure of relaxing in Caroline’s warm and cosy beauty room for my facial. After talking through what would happen, I just laid back and felt the stress I didn’t even realise I was holding melt away. I left feeling relaxed, refreshed and re-energised.”  
> — Gaynor *(Facial)*

> “I had a facial with Caz a few days ago and it was amazing. She explained what each product would do at every stage, and the treatment felt luxurious but purposeful. I left with glowing skin and I’ll definitely be back.”  
> — Catherine *(Facial)*

> “I’ve had many facials over the years, but this is probably the best. Caz’s treatment room feels like a secret hideaway and the whole experience was incredibly relaxing and professional.”  
> — Jenni *(Facial & massage)*

## Get in touch

I don’t use online booking at the moment, as I like to keep appointments flexible and tailored to each person.

The easiest way to start is to send me a message with:
- what you’re interested in (facial / head massage / not sure yet)
- any skin concerns or goals (only if you’d like to share)
- a couple of days/times that usually suit you

I’ll reply with my current availability and a simple recommendation.
