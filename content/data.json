I’ve been a Marpler since the age of seven, and today I’m living out a dream I never expected: running my own holistic skin and wellbeing retreat from my garden.\n\nMy working life began in the beauty industry as a hairdresser before I moved into finance and insurance. In 2021, everything changed when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. After successful treatment, I knew I wanted to do something more meaningful — something that helped people feel supported, relaxed, and cared for.\n\nIf you’d like to read more about how Pure Glow Wellness began, you can find my full story below.",
    "full_bio": "Hello, I’m Caroline. I’m 51, married to my Aussie husband Mic, a proud mum of three gorgeous children, and dog mum to two lively pups. I’ve been a Marpler since the age of seven (with a few wonderful years living in Australia along the way), and today I’m living out a dream I never expected: running my own holistic skin and wellbeing retreat from my garden.\n\nMy working life began in the beauty industry as a hairdresser, before I moved into finance and insurance. In 2021, everything changed when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. After successful treatment, I was given the opportunity to pause, reflect, and re-evaluate what truly mattered to me. I knew then that I wanted to do something more meaningful — something that helped people feel supported, relaxed, and cared for.\n\nI discovered Tropic Skincare completely by accident, and it became a turning point in my life. I fell in love with the incredible results, but even more so with the ethics behind the brand: green, cruelty-free, and made without harsh chemicals. After seeing such positive changes in my own skin, I became a Tropic Ambassador, a role I’m deeply passionate about.\n\nMy journey didn’t stop there. Wanting to extend my offering and care for others in a deeper way, I trained in facials and Indian head massage, took a leap of faith, left my job, and opened my own treatment room, The Retreat. Tucked away in the corner of my garden, surrounded by trees and wildlife, it is a calm, private, and nurturing space designed for you to truly switch off.\n\nI specialise in customer-focused, results-driven facials, where we take time to chat, understand your skin, your lifestyle, and your concerns, so every treatment is completely tailored to you. My aim is for every client to leave feeling relaxed, cared for, and confident in their skin.\n\nAlongside my business, I’m also a proud volunteer with Breast Cancer Now, supporting women who are currently facing diagnosis and treatment, a cause that will always be close to my heart.\n\nEverything I do is rooted in care, connection, and integrity. Whether you visit me for skincare, relaxation, or support, my goal is simple: to offer you a safe space to rest, reset, and feel truly looked after.",

The treatment felt very luxurious, but also like it was genuinely nourishing my skin. The pressure was just right and I left with glowing skin. I’ll definitely be back soon. Thank you."
