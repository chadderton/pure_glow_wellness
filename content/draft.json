    "body": "Hi, I’m Caroline. After years working in insurance and finance, I decided it was time to do something that felt meaningful, not just “a job”. I retrained in facials and holistic wellbeing because I love the way a calm space and the right treatment can change how you feel.\n\nEverything I do is gentle, thoughtful, and tailored. Some people come purely for relaxation. Others want support as their skin changes with stress, hormones, or life events. I also offer supportive, comfort-first treatments for clients navigating recovery after cancer treatment. Whatever has brought you here, you’ll be welcomed, listened to, and never rushed.\n\nPure Glow Wellness is my umbrella for three strands: facials (open now), corporate wellbeing, and PT for women navigating midlife and menopause (coming later as I complete my training).",
